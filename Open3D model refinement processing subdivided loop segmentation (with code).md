##  1. Overview of the principle 

   The mesh refinement process involves dividing each triangle into smaller triangles. The simplest way is to calculate the midpoint of each side of the triangle and divide it into four smaller triangles. This is achieved through the subdivide_midpoint function. The 3D surface and area remain the same, but the number of vertices and triangles increases. number_of_iterations parameter defines the number of refinements.
