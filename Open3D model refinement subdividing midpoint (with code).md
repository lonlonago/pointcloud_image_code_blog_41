#  I. Overview of algorithms 

   Triangles are refined using a simple midpoint algorithm. Each iteration subdivides the triangle into four triangles, with the subdivided vertices located at the midpoint of the original triangle's edge. number_of_iterations parameter defines the number of refinements.

  ```  
 This function transforms the triangle into four triangles covering the same surface, with the new quadrilateral vertices located at the midpoint of the sides of the original triangle.
